Market Requirement

Assignment: The general aim of this project is to simulate a banking system which is secure and easy to use. Previously the system was manual, not secure, also working slowly. This proposed system overcomes the lacking of the existing manual system.

1.All branches of the Bank provide the Banking services to customers and had to send report to the central branch manually, which sometimes creates problem to get, up-to-date information rapidly.

2.Now through this system whenever any transaction will be taking place it will store in the central database and authorized person can get necessary information or report when they get into the system from any branches through LAN and WAN.

3.To implement our project, we have used Packet Tracer 5.3 for network simulation. After implementation of all functions, the system is tested in different stages and it was successful for its purpose.

4.It provides support to various applications of banking. This Network will let various users of the bank and their employees connect to the main Server. The objective only authorized user to access Network including all servers and network devices.

5.It provides greater speed & reduce time consumption and 99.99% of uptime of Network. It allocates bandwidth to servers accordingly. The proposed Network will be user-friendly so that even a beginner can troubleshoot any issue easily.
